# EDA Summary Report

## Methodology
Data was scraped from eBay. After scraping, data was cleaned by standardizing formats and removing unnecessary formating and duplicates.

## Key Findings
- **'Apple'** is the most frequent keyword in product titles.
- Many listings don't show shipping information.(From my scrapping)
- Majority of products aren't discounted.

## Challenges
- **Data Collection**: Automation of scrapping was a bit messed.
- **Data Cleaning**: Data and currency formats required regex (thank you chatgpt) to clean the data.
